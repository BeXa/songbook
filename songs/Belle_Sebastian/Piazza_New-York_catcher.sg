\beginverse
\[Fa#]Elope with me Miss Private and we'll \[Si]sail around the \[Fa#]world
\[Sol#m]I will be your Ferdinand and \[Re#m]you my wayward girl
How \[Sol#m]many nights of talking in ho\[Do#]tel rooms can you take?
How \[Sol#m]many nights of limping round on \[Do#]pagan holidays?
Oh e\[Si]lope with me in private and we'll \[Re#m]set something ablaze
A \[Sol#m]trail for the \[Do#]devil to \[Re#m]erase 
\endverse
\beginverse
San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay ?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest ending of a book you ever had to read
The statue's crying too and well he may
\endverse

\beginverse
I love you I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you my responsibility has found a place 
Beside you and strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the wider family net absurd
You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job?
Maybe, but not what she deserves
\endverse

\beginverse
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
\endverse

\beginverse
The catcher hits for .318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway 
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench
\endverse

\beginverse
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like ``Walk Away, Renee''
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour
\endverse
