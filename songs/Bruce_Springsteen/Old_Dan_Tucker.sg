  \beginverse
    \[C]Old Dan Tucker was a \[F]fine old man
    \[G]Washed his face with a \[C]fryin' pan
    \[C]Combed his hair with a \[F]wagon wheel
    And \[G]died with a toothache \[C]in his heel
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[C]Get out the way, \[F]Old Dan Tucker
    \[G]{You're} too late to \[C]get your supper
    \rep{2}
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Now Old Dan Tucker come to town
    Ridin' a billy goat, leadin' a hound
    The hound dog barked and billy goat jumped
    And landed old Tucker on a stump
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Now Old Dan Tucker got drunk and fell
    In the fire and kicked up holy hell
    A red-hot coal got in his shoe
    And, oh my Lord, the ashes flew!
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Now Old Dan Tucker come to town
    Swinging them ladies all round
    First to the right and then to the left
    Then to the gal that he loved best
  \endverse
