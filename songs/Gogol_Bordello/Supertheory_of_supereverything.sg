  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    \[Lam]Put \[Mi]me inside SS\[Lam]C
    \[Lam]Let's \[Mi]test superstring \[Lam]theory

  \beginverse*
    Do you have sex maniacs
    Or schizophrenics
    Or astrophysicists in your family
    Was my grandma anti anti
    Was my grandpa bounty bounty
    He he he he
    They ask in embassy
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    And my grandma, she was anti
    And my grandpa, he was bounty
    Ah stir it twice
    And then just add me
