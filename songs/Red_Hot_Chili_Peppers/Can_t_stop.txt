  \beginverse
    \[Mim]Can't stop addicted to the shindig
    \[Ré]Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
    \[Si]Choose not a life of imitation
    \[Do]Distant cousin to the reservation
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Defunct the pistol that you pay for
    This punk the feeling that you stay for
    In time I want to be your best friend
    Eastside love is living on the westend
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Knocked out but boy you better come to
    Don't die you know the truth as some do
    Go write your message on the pavement
    Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    White heat is screaming in the jungle
    Complete the motion if you stumble
    Go ask the dust for any answers
    Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    The \[Sol]world I love, the \[Ré]tears I've dropped
    To \[Sim]be part of, the \[Do]wave can't stop
    \[Sol]Ever wonder \[Ré]if it's \[Sim]all for \[Do]you
  \endverse
  
  \beginverse*
    The world I love, the trains I hop
    To be part of, the wave can't stop
    Come and tell me when it's time to
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
    So smart she's leading me to ozone
    Music the great communicator
    Use two sticks to make it in the nature
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    I'll get you into penetration
    The gender of a generation
    The birth of every other nation
    Worth your weight the gold of meditation
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    This chapter's going to be a close one
    Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
    All on a spaceship persevering
    Use my hands for everything but steering
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Can't stop the spirits when they need you
    Mop tops are happy when they feed you
    Jay butterfly is in the treetop
    Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
  \endverse


  \beginchorus
    \[Mim]Wait a minute, I'm \[Ré]passing out
    Win or \[Sim]lose, just like \[Do]you
    \[Mim]Far more shockin' than an\[Ré]ything 
    I ever \[Sim]knew, how 'bout \[Do]you
  \endchorus
  
  \beginchorus
    Ten more reasons why 
    I need somebody new, just like you
    Far more shockin' than anything 
    I ever knew, right on cue
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Can't stop addicted to the shindig
    Chop top he says I'm gonna win big
    Choose not a life of imitation
    Distant cousin to the reservation
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Defunct the pistol that you pay for
    This punk the feeling that you stay for
    In time I want to be your best friend
    Eastside love is living on the westend
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Knocked out but boy you better come to
    Don't die you know the truth as some do
    Go write your message on the pavement
    Burn so bright I wonder what the wave meant
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Kick start the golden generator
    Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
    Can't stop the Gods from engineering
    Feel no need for any interfering
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Your image in the dictionary
    This life is more than ordinary
    Can I get two maybe even three of these
    Comin' from space to teach you of the Pliedes
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    Can't stop the spirits when they need you
    This life is more than just a read-thru
  \endverse
