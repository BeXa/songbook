  \beginverse
    I re\[Sol]member when rock was young
    Me and \[Mim]Susie had so much fun
    Holding \[Do]hands and skimming stones
    Had an \[Ré]old gold Chevy and a place of my own
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    But the biggest kick I ever got
    Was doing a thing called the \emph{crocodile rock}
    While the other kids were Rocking round the clock
    We were hopping and bopping to the \emph{crocodile rock}
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[Mim]Well crocodile-rocking is something shocking
    When your \[La7]feet just cant keep still
    \[Ré7]{I never} knew me a better time and I \[Sol]guess I never will
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
    Oh, Lawdy mama those Friday nights
    When Susie wore her dresses tight
    And the crocodile-rocking was out of \[Do]sight
  \endchorus

  \beginchorus
    \[Sol]La, la la la la \[Mim]la
    La la la la \[Do]la, la la la la \[Ré]la
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    But the years went by and the rock just died
    Susie went and left us for some foreign guy
    Long nights cryin' by the record machine
    Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
  \endverse

  \beginverse*
    But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
    Burning up to the \emph{crocodile rock}
    Learning fast as the weeks went past
    We really thought that the \emph{crocodile rock} would last
  \endverse
