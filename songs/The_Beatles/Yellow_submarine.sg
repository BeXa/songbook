  \beginverse
    So we sailed up to the sun
    Till we found the sea of green
    And we lived beneath the waves
    In our yellow submarine
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    \[G]We all live in our \[D]yellow submarine
    Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine
    \[G]We all live in our \[D]yellow submarine
    Yellow submarine, \[G]yellow submarine
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    And our friends are all on board
    Many more of them live next door
    And the band begins to play
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    As we live a life of ease
    Everyone of us has all we need
    Sky of blue and sea of green
    In our yellow submarine
  \endverse
