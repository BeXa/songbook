\beginverse
And in the sea there is a fish,
A fish that has a secret wish,
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it.
And in the sea there is a fish,
A fish that has a secret wish,
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it.
\endverse

\beginverse
And the flower
Would be its offering
Of love to the desert.
And the desert,
So dry and lonely,
That the creatures all
Appreciate the effort.
\endverse

\beginverse
Et le jackalope a dit:
``Je voudrais être un yéti
Pour voler dans la nuit
Et m'en aller loin d'ici''
Mais le yéti a dit:
``Je voudrais être un monstre marin
Pour pouvoir sauter dans la mer
De tous les requins''
\endverse

\beginverse
And the rattlesnake said: ``I wish I had hands
So I could hug you like a man.''
And then the cactus said:
``Don't you understand ?
My skin is covered with sharp spikes
That'll stab you like a thousand knives.
A hug would be nice,
But hug my flower with your eyes.''
