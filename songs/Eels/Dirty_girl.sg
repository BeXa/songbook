  \beginverse
    \[C]{I like} a \[G]girl with a \[F]dirty mouth
    \[C]Someone that I can be\[G]lieve
    \[C]We had a \[G]window not \[F]open too long
    But \[C]that time is \[G]good and \[C]gone
  \endverse

  \beginchorus
    And if I ever \[G]see her a\[Am]gain
    She's walking \[Dm]{by with} some new \[F]guy \[G]
    I know that we will \[G]need to pre\[Am]tend
    And hope our \[Dm]eyes keep telling \[F]lies \[G]
  \endchorus

  \beginverse
    Sit on the back porch and wonder about her
    What is she doing right now?
    Making somebody a happier man
    Dying her hair back to brown
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    Once in a while your life gets so good
    Worth all the trouble of the past?
    That was the case but I think I always knew
    Good things don't ever last
  \endverse

  \beginverse
    I like a girl with a dirty mouth
    Know that I can trust her
    We had our time but it didn't last too long
    And that time is good and gone \rep{3}
  \endverse
